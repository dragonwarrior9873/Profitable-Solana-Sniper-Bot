The Pump.fun Sniper Bot checks the pools that moves from Pump.fun to Raydium by hitting the bonding curve using streams from grpc endpoint.
It can intercept from 1 to 3 block and with fast and business gayser api keys, it can intercept even in the first block too.

The Meteora Sniper Bot also checks the pools wheter it's DLMM or AMM and catch the moment of pool creation and execute transactions for making profits.
It works perfectly for DLMM too and make profits.
